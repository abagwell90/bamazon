What the project does?:

This is a Amazon-like storefront with MySQL as the database to store the inventory. In my store I have 10 different fruits/vegetables with different inventory levels and prices for each item. 

Here's how the app works?:

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 
My app prompts the user to answer two questions:
What fruit or vegetable do you want to order?
How many do you want to buy?
Based on these answers, my SQL database will be updated. 

The table in MySQL database contains:
item_id (unique id for each product)
product_name (Name of product)
department_name
price (cost to customer)
stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

Why the project is useful?:

Teaches me javascript, node, MySQL, Inquirer. 

Who maintains and contributes to the project?:

Andrew J Bagwell.
